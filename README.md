# Online-E--Challan-project
The Online E-Challan System is an application that aims to automate the process of traffic violation tracking and penalty management. The system allows users (drivers, vehicles owners, etc.) to receive, view, and pay their traffic fines online through an e-challan. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this project leverages the full capabilities of the modern web development stack to create an intuitive and responsive platform.
